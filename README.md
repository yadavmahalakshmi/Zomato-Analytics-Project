# Dataset Description
(Dataset is not included in this repository as per institutional guidelines.)
The analysis was conducted on a dataset containing restaurant-level and customer-level information sourced from Zomato. Key attributes included:
 Restaurant details and location
 Cuisine type and service categories
 Ratings and user votes
 Cost metrics
 Delivery time and service availability
These variables were utilized for trend identification, performance comparison, and visualization.

# Key Insights
Higher-rated restaurants generally maintain faster delivery times, indicating operational efficiency contributes to better customer feedback.
A few cuisine categories, notably North Indian, Chinese, and Continental, dominate customer preferences across locations.
Lower-priced restaurants attract larger order volumes, whereas premium restaurants show consistent but lower traffic.
Several geographic areas exhibit high demand but comparatively lower ratings, suggesting opportunities for service enhancement.
Delivery time remains a major factor influencing overall customer satisfaction and rating distribution.

# Future Enhancements
Implementation of a machine learning-based restaurant rating or demand prediction model.
Development of a recommendation system for personalized restaurant suggestions.
Integration of customer review sentiment analysis for deeper qualitative insights.
Addition of time-series forecasting to predict seasonal or monthly order trends.
Incorporation of geospatial analysis for identifying high-potential service areas.
Enhancement of dashboards using real-time or API-based Zomato data sources.
